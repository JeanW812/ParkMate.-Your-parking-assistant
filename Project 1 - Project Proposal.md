# Project 1 - Project Proposal

## <ins>Problem</ins>

The​‍​‌‍​‍‌ world is full of different smart parking systems that include automatic pay stations and barriers, auto pay parking systems, active RFID parking systems, robotic parking systems, Parking Guidance and Information System (PGIS), transit-based information system, smart payment system, e-parking, and automated parking<sup>[1]</sup>. This Human Computer Interaction (HCI) project focused on identifying the typical issues with indoor car parking systems as well as an innovative solution of a smart parking system to solve the ​‍​‌‍​‍‌problem.


Based on the research, the conventional indoor car parking system does not provide the drivers regarding the availability of parking spaces. As a result, many of the drivers who enter the parking lot waste their time searching for parking. The conventional indoor car parking system will just open the barrier when drivers press the automated machine for tickets or tap their TouchNGo card to enter without showing the availability number of parking spaces<sup>[1]</sup> which can be shown in Figure 1.1 below.
